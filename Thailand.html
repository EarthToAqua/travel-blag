      <em>A place very close to our hearts</em>

        We started in Thailand for our first long-term trip in 2016. We adored our little island paradise here as we earned our first
        proffesional SCUBA qualifications. We spent some of our happiest days here, introducing tourists to the magnificent
        underwater world Thailand has to offer. We loved it so much we returned in 2019 for another round. We met some wonderful
        people, had some wild experiences and enjoyed capturing Thailand's serenity through the lense.
